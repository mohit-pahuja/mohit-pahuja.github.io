**Beginners often ask me questions about how to get started in the field of data science** or machine learning, and I would end up sharing with them my own learning path, and it worked every time! It would save them lots of time wasted in exploring courses that were bad, tutorials that were not clear and guides that just didn't work!

In this article, I'm going to share with you **step by step method on how you can land a job in data science** in matter of few months!

### 1: Understand The Industry!
Data Science is all about data. We can use data to extract information, to **find insights**, to **make future predictions**, or to **build smart algorithms** such as for translating between different languages! Once you know what data science or machine learning is all about, you can delve deep into the courses to build a solid foundation.


### 2: Learn To Code!
Your first and foremost duty should be learn how to do code! It can't get simpler than that. The de-facto language for doing data science is Python. You should **learn not only how to code, but also to code efficiently**! Having good knowlegde of databases helps a lot.

- **Course #1:** [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science on EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
- **Course #2:** [Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-videos/)
- **Course #3:** [Introduction to Databases](rnao)

Other than these, you should also learn about the latest technologies being used in the industry. Don't worry, learning these is going to be super easy!

- Git and Github
- IDEs and Text Editors
- Python Programming Language
- SQL

### 2: Learn The Mathematics!
The second step is to learn the **prerequisties to understand the machine learning algorithms**. It includes the basics of probability theory, high school calculus and lots of linear algebra !

- **Course #1:** [Introduction to Probability](link)
- **Course #2:** [MIT's Linear Algebra](link)

### 3: Learn ML Algorithms!
This is the most fun part, where you will **learn the machine learning alorithms** used to build smart software such as face recognition or speech-to-text!

- **Course #1:** [Stanford's CS229](link)
- **Course #2:** [Tom Mitchell's PhD Course](link)
- **Course #3:** [Computer Vision](link)
- **Course #4:** [Natural Language Processing](link)


### 4: Prepare For Interviews!
Well, preparing for the interviews is also a big effort. But these are basic things you must do in order to land a job!

- Build a resume
- Do Data Science Projects
- Get Referrals!
